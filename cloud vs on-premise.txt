Question: Think about an architecture for this use case, so that we can run it in production. You can choose between Cloud and On-Premise. (You dont have to implement it).

Response:

Considering the criteria below, when handling sensitive information the on-premise approach is more suitable as it's more secure and all the processes are done within the company. 
The cloud solution is more flexible and scaling would be easier and cheaper. For the usecase in the assignment, given that there is no sensitive information being used a cloud solution would be the better approach in my opinion
as scaling of the usecase would be more efficient and securitywise the cloud should provide sufficient security but.
Processing the data, in my view, could be done in batches. 


Deployment
    On-Premise
        + the deployment would happen on the company servers and all processes are handled within the company.
    Cloud
        + installation and configuration of an application could be easier.
        + it could be scaled more easily by just adding/removing resources when needed.
---------------
Control
    On-Premise
        + control and hanlding/managing of the data is a responsibility of the company.
    Cloud
        - the data and and encryption keys are in the hands of the cloud provider so the company does not have full control of it's data
---------------
Security
    On-Premise
        + more secure because all the information is stored and managed in-house and the company is handling it's level of security.
    Cloud
        - There is a possibility for cloud breaches and sensitive information being stolen. 
        + regular back-ups of the data
---------------
Regulatory Compliance
    On-Premise
        + the regulatory compliance is in the hands of the company.
    Cloud
        - the company needs to assess and choose a cloud provider that is compliant to all the needed regulations within the region.
---------------
Cost
    On-Premise
        - maintenance and scaling would need to be handled by the company which would be more expensive and rigid. 
    Cloud
        + the cloud provider is responsible for the maintenance and servers. The company would pay only for the storage/facilities that it actually needs.
